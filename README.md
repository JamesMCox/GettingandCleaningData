# GettingandCleaningData
This is the repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

The main goal is to run run_analysis.R 

  The R program assumes the data is already downloaded to your working directory 
      The name of the file is “getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip”.
  If you open the R console and type in source(“run_analysis.R”), it will run the whole data clean up work
  The program will take some time to run, but it should not exceed a couple of minutes.
  After the program is complete, it will produce “tidy-data-set.txt” which is the cleaned tidy data set the assignment asked.
    The format of “tidy-data-set.txt” and transformation process of “run_analysis.R” are documented in CodeBook.md.
    Additional program documentation is included in the run_analysis.R file
