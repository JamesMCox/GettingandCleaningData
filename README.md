# GettingandCleaningData
This is the repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

The main goal is to run run_analysis.R 

  The R program assumes the data is already downloaded to your working directory 
  
      The name of the file used is “getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip”.
  
  If you open the R console and type in source(“run_analysis.R”), it will complete the cleaning data process.
  
  The program will take some time to run, but it should not exceed a couple of minutes.
  
  After the program is complete, it will produce “tidy_data_set.txt” which is the cleaned tidy data set the assignment asked.
  
  The format of “tidy_data_set.txt” and transformation process of “run_analysis.R” are documented in CodeBook.md.
  
  Additional program documentation is included in the run_analysis.R file.
